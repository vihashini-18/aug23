Every student’s performance is shaped by a mix of study habits, sleep patterns, and how often they attend classes. Teachers and parents often wonder:

👉 “If a student studies more, but sleeps less, will they still perform well?”
👉 “Does attendance really matter as much as we think?”
👉 “Can we predict whether a student is likely to pass or fail before exams?”

This project tries to answer those questions using Machine Learning.

The Idea 💡

We took real-life factors like hours studied, sleep duration, and attendance percentage to build a model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail. Instead of guessing, the computer learns from past data and finds hidden patterns.

How It Works 🛠️

The dataset contains students’ daily habits and their final results.

We train a Decision Tree model – just like how teachers make rules in their mind:

“If a student studies more than 6 hours and attends classes regularly, they are more likely to pass.”

We also use an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model – which tries to draw a clear line between “Pass” and “Fail” students.

Why This Matters 🎯

Imagine a student with:

8 hours of study

6 hours of sleep

80% attendance

Our model can predict if they are on track to pass or at risk of failing.

This is powerful because:

Students can understand where they stand and improve early.

Teachers can identify which students need extra help.

Parents get a realistic picture beyond just test scores.

The Bigger Picture 🌍

This project shows how Machine Learning can support education—not by replacing teachers, but by giving them data-driven insights. It’s like having a smart assistant that looks at patterns from hundreds of students and says:

👉 “Based on habits, this student might need more focus on attendance.”
👉 “This student studies well, but lack of sleep could pull down performance.”

In short, the project combines data + human intuition to help students succeed.
